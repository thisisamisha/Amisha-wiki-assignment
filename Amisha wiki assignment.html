<h1>Sepsis</h1>

<p>Sepsis, formerly known as septicemia (septicaemia in British English) or blood poisoning,[8][9] is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.[4][8]</p>
    
<p>Sepsis is caused by many organisms including bacteria, viruses and fungi.[12] Common locations for the primary infection include the lungs, brain, urinary tract, skin, and abdominal organs.[2]</p>

<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>

<p>In addition to symptoms related to the actual cause, people with sepsis may have a fever, low body temperature, rapid breathing, a fast heart rate, confusion, and edema.[19]</p>

<p>Fever is the most common presenting symptom in sepsis, but fever may be absent in some people such as the elderly or those who are immunocompromised.[21]

    The drop in blood pressure seen in sepsis can cause lightheadedness and is part of the criteria for septic shock.[22]</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)</h3>

<p>According to SIRS, there were different levels of sepsis: sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.[9] The definition of SIRS is shown below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>SIRS is the presence of two or more of the following: abnormal body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood gas, and white blood cell count.</li>
    <li>Sepsis is defined as SIRS in response to an infectious process.[46]</li>
    <li>Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate, or decreased urine output). Severe sepsis is an infectious disease state associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)[11]</li>
    <li>Septic shock is severe sepsis plus persistently low blood pressure, despite the administration of intravenous fluids.[11]</li>
</ul>
